<p>For the purpose of this demo, we'll track the application name
	environment variable when starting the test.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Deploy V2 (green) of the application</li>
	<li>Add the <i>production route</i> to application V2 (green)
	</li>
	<li>Ensure to control the load from V1 (blue) to V2 (green) by
		making sure you have more V1 (blue) application instance. For example,
		2 x 1 application instances ensure V1 (blue) gets double the amount of
		requests.
	<li>Decrease V1 (blue) instances, increase V2 (green) as
		confidence builds</li>
	<li>Remove the <i>production route</i> of V1 (blue).
	</li>
</ol>
