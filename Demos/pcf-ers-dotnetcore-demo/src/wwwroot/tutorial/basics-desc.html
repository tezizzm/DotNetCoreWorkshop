	Pivotal Cloud Foundry Application Services is the core platform service
	responsible for running application as containers. The services runs
	applications written in different languages and frameworks. The
	container runtime engine provides container image construction, load
	distribution, access management, high availability, health monitoring
	among many other services.<a

<p>PCF Application Services, as a distribute system, is composed of many
	microservices that work together to provide platform capabilities.</p>

<p>In the diagram above we have depicted some core component of the
	PCF Application Services.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Router</b> - Entry point to the platform.</li>
	<li><b>Cloud Controller</b> - Handle the platform API calls. E.g
		scale, apps, push.</li>
	<li><b>Blob Store</b> - Where container images, or droplets, are
		stored.</li>
	<li><b>Metadata Store</b> - Information about deployed
		applications and configured services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Then we have <b>Runtime VMs</b> which are a pool of VMs responsible for
	managing the application container workload. In this diagram we have 3
	applications each with its own route (URL) and number of instances.
	We'll see that the <b>router</b> load balances application requests to
	a route to the group of application instances associated with the
	route. <a
