	To get here we simply used the CF CLI PUSH command to deploy your
	application or artifact. We often use a manifest yaml file to
	encapsulate the command option. The application binaries and metadata

<p>PCF Application Services run applications in containers and part of
	the PCF staging process is to create an application container image
	called droplet.</p>

	<b>Note:</b> PCF also supports running applications from a docker
	image. In that case, the buildpack is not used during the staging
	process.
